Here's an analysis of the error log, categorized by risk level for each mentioned tool:

---

### High Risk

Issues in this category are critical failures that prevent a tool from performing its intended function entirely, potentially leaving significant gaps in code quality, security, or type checking.

*   **Tool: `eslint`**
    *   **Summary:** ESLint failed to execute because the command was not recognized. This indicates that ESLint is either not installed or not accessible in the system's PATH. Consequently, no JavaScript or TypeScript linting was performed, leaving potential code quality issues, stylistic inconsistencies, and basic errors unchecked.
    *   **Action:** Install ESLint (globally or locally via npm/yarn) and ensure it's available in the execution environment's PATH. Verify the project's `package.json` for ESLint dependencies and scripts.

---

### Medium Risk

Issues in this category indicate that a tool is present but did not perform its primary function as expected, likely due to incorrect invocation or missing configuration, potentially leading to unchecked code.

*   **Tool: `tsc` (TypeScript Compiler)**
    *   **Summary:** The TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) was found and executed, but it only displayed its help message (version and command options). This typically happens when `tsc` is run without arguments or a specified `tsconfig.json` in a context where one isn't automatically detected. As a result, no TypeScript files (if any exist) were compiled or type-checked, meaning critical type errors or compilation failures would go undetected.
    *   **Action:** Review the script or command used to invoke `tsc`. Ensure it's correctly configured to compile the project by pointing to a `tsconfig.json` file (e.g., `tsc -p .` or `tsc --build`) or specifying relevant TypeScript files.

---

### Low Risk

Issues in this category are often informational or indicate that a tool ran successfully but found no relevant files to process. While not critical failures, they might point to missing code, incorrect project scope, or unnecessary tool execution.

*   **Tool: `pylint`**
    *   **Summary:** Pylint executed successfully but reported "No Python files". This means that Pylint found no `.py` files to analyze within its configured scope. It could indicate an absence of Python code in the repository, an incorrect working directory, or a misconfigured Pylint command.
    *   **Action:** If Python files are expected, verify the project structure and the Pylint command's target directories. If no Python code is part of this repository, this message can be disregarded.

*   **Tool: `bandit`**
    *   **Summary:** Bandit executed successfully but reported "No Python files". Similar to Pylint, this means no Python files were found for security analysis within its scope.
    *   **Action:** If Python files are expected for security scanning, verify the project structure and Bandit's command to ensure it targets the correct directories. If no Python code is part of this repository, this message can be disregarded.

*   **Tool: `semgrep`**
    *   **Summary:** Semgrep executed successfully but reported "No Python files". This indicates that Semgrep did not find any Python files to apply its rules against, likely due to an absence of such files, an incorrect scope, or rules targeting other languages.
    *   **Action:** If Python files are expected for static analysis, verify the project structure and the Semgrep command's target directories and rule sets. If no Python code is part of this repository, this message can be disregarded.
